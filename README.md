Using this to host changes to my website. Time to learn how to code all at once.

    Although I have been working in Tech since High School, I have had an almost allergic reaction to coding. It makes me 5 different types of uncomforatble to code so as my new pet project I will force myself to code as often as possible to get through the long backlog of projects that I do have. I started to do this through sublime text editor and sync through Filezilla but I found the VS Code to Github combo to be (free) much more my speed. Gives me more of an opportunity to learn through as many thigns as possible in rapid succession.
